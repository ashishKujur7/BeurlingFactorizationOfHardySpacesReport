This is evolving to be my masters thesis on "Inner Outer Factorization of Hardy Spaces". I am reading the book [Banach Spaces of Analytic Functions](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/banach-spaces-of-analytic-functions) by [Kenneth Hoffman](https://math.mit.edu/about/history/obituaries/hoffman.php) under the supervision of [Dr. Md. Ramiz Reza](https://iisertvm.ac.in/faculty/ramiz).
