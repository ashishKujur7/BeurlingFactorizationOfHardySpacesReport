# Beurling Factorization of Hardy Spaces
Hello! This is my masters report for my MSc in Mathematics. I studied [Hardy spaces on the disk and the circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy_space) and the [Beurling Factorization of Hardy spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy_space#Factorization_into_inner_and_outer_functions). My masters' advisor was [Dr. Md. Ramiz Reza](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/faculty/ramiz/personal-information).

Here's [the final report](https://github.com/ashishKujur7/HardySpaces/blob/main/mastersThesisDraft.pdf).
